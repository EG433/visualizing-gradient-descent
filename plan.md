# Plans

- Intro: explain optimization, calculating cost, and why gradient descent is useful
- Iris: show example on how gradient descent is used, but this problem is very simple, linearly seperable
- Vertical: show gradient descent working on a non seperable dataset, explain that linear functions dont need gradient descent because they have solutions (which can be found in a simular way to gradient descent)
- Spiral: Give an example of gradient descent optimizing a nonlinear function, use nnfs or something
- MAYBE Playground: add and remove layers and neurons then find a solution.

All of this is a very tentative plan its 2 in the morning, I dont know how this turns into a video
